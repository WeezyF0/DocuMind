A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that ingests PowerPoint, PDF, and DOCX files, extracts text, tables, and images, stores them in a vector database, and leverages an LLM (e.g., Google Gemini or GPT) to answer queries by combining document content with the model‚Äôs world knowledge.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**DocuMind** is a proof-of-concept demonstrating how to turn arbitrary documents (PDFs, PPTs, DOCXs) into a question-answering system that:

1. **Partitions & preprocesses** each document‚Äôs contents (text, tables, images).
2. **Embeds** extracted chunks into a vector store (Chroma).
3. **Retrieves** relevant passages at query-time.
4. **Combines** retrieved context with a large language model (LLM) (e.g., Google Gemini, Groq, or OpenAI ChatGPT) to generate a polished answer that weaves in both document data and the model‚Äôs inherent knowledge.

> **Use Cases:**  
> - Instant Q&A over slide decks, research papers, or lengthy reports  
> - Summarization of tables/figures + contextual explanation  
> - Building chatbots that ‚Äúknow‚Äù your proprietary docs + general knowledge

> ## The Waterfall Model: A Classic Approach to Software Development
>
> ### 1. Definition  
> The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential software development lifecycle (SDLC) approach. It's characterized by a series of distinct phases, where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. Think of it like a waterfall cascading down a series of steps ‚Äì once the water flows past a step, it cannot go back. (Retrieved information)  
>
> ### 2. Key Characteristics and Phases  
> The Waterfall model operates through these primary phases: (Retrieved information)  
>
> - **Requirement Analysis:** This is the crucial initial stage where all possible requirements for the system are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This includes understanding user needs, business objectives, and desired functionalities. The goal is to create a comprehensive and unambiguous requirements specification. (Retrieved information)  
> - **System Design:** Based on the defined requirements, a system design is created. This encompasses the hardware and software architecture, data structures, interfaces, and overall system architecture. High-level design and low-level design documents are typically produced in this phase. (Retrieved information)  
> - **Implementation:** This is the coding phase, where the system is built according to the design specifications. The system is often broken down into modules or units, which are then coded and integrated. (Retrieved information)  
> - **System Testing:** After implementation, the system undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. This involves various types of testing, including unit testing (testing individual components), integration testing (testing the interaction between components), system testing (testing the entire system), and user acceptance testing (UAT) (testing by end-users). Defects identified are reported and fixed. (Retrieved information)  
> - **System Deployment:** Once testing is complete and the system is deemed satisfactory, it's deployed to the production environment where it can be used by end-users. This involves installation, configuration, and data migration. (Retrieved information)  
> - **System Maintenance:** After deployment, the system enters the maintenance phase. This involves monitoring the system for issues, providing support to users, and applying necessary updates, patches, and enhancements to ensure continued operation and meet evolving user needs. (Retrieved information)  
>
> **Key Characteristics Summarized:** (Retrieved information)  
> - **Sequential:** Strict, linear progression through phases.  
> - **Phase-driven:** Each phase has specific deliverables and milestones.  
> - **Document-heavy:** Relies heavily on documentation at each phase.  
> - **Limited Iteration:** Minimal to no iteration or feedback loops between phases.  
>
> ### 3. Real-World Examples and Applications  
> While the pure Waterfall model is less common in modern software development, it can be suitable in specific scenarios: (Retrieved information)  
>
> - **Embedded Systems:** Development of control software for devices with well-defined and stable requirements.  
> - **Medical Device Software:** Where regulatory compliance and detailed documentation are paramount.  
> - **Simple Information Systems:** Small projects with clearly understood and unchanging requirements.  
> - **Government projects:** Projects with strict requirements.  
>
> ### 4. Advantages and Disadvantages  
>
> **Advantages:**  
> - **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement.  
> - **Well-defined stages:** Clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.  
> - **Manageability:** Easier to manage due to the rigid structure.  
> - **Documentation:** Forces thorough documentation throughout the development process.  
>
> **Disadvantages:** (Retrieved information)  
> - **Inflexibility:** Difficult to accommodate changes to requirements once a phase is complete. This is the biggest drawback.  
> - **Late Delivery of Working Software:** A working version of the system is not available until late in the project's lifecycle.  
> - **Risk:** High risk and uncertainty.  
> - **Not suitable for complex projects:** Not suitable for large or complex projects where requirements are likely to change or be poorly understood at the outset. (Retrieved information)  
> - **Limited customer involvement:** Customer involvement is typically limited to the requirements phase.  
>
> ### 5. When to Use (and Not Use) the Waterfall Model  
>
> The Waterfall model is most appropriate when: (Retrieved information)  
> - Requirements are very well-defined, documented, and stable.  
> - The project is relatively small and not overly complex.  
> - The technology used is well-understood and not rapidly changing.  
> - The project team has experience with similar projects.  
> - A strict, sequential process is required for compliance reasons.  
>
> **Avoid the Waterfall model when:** (Retrieved information)  
> - Requirements are likely to change or evolve during the project.  
> - The project is large and complex.  
> - There is a need for frequent feedback from stakeholders.  
> - The technology is new or rapidly evolving.  
>
> ### 6. Alternatives to the Waterfall Model  
> Due to the limitations of the Waterfall model, various alternative software development methodologies have emerged, including:  
>
> - **Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban):** Emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.  
> - **Iterative Model:** Allows for some repetition of work.  
> - **Spiral Model:** Combines elements of the waterfall model with iterative prototyping and risk analysis.  
> - **V-Model:** Places emphasis on verification and validation.  
>
> ### 7. Conclusion  
> The Waterfall model is a foundational concept in software development. While its rigid structure makes it less suitable for many modern projects, understanding its principles is essential for comprehending the evolution of software development methodologies and for recognizing situations where a more structured approach might still be beneficial. While many other models have surpassed the waterfall model in popularity, it is still very relevant to the field.
